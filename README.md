## Overview

This is a **Fintech** app built with **React Native** using a **Component-Based Architecture**. The app provides users with a seamless experience for investment management, tracking financial goals, and viewing personalized portfolios. The app leverages modular design principles, allowing easy maintenance, scalability, and reusability of components. 

This app handles core Fintech functionalities like:
- Managing financial goals.
- Selecting personalized investment portfolios.
- Viewing financial metrics and insights.
- Creating, updating, and managing user-specific investment goals.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile development framework.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe language for JavaScript.
- **Segment Analytics**: To track user behavior and events.
- **Expo**: For building, running, and debugging the app.
- **State Management**: Simple context-based state management for storing form data.
- **Styled Components**: Custom styles for a consistent UI/UX experience.

## Architecture

This app follows a **Component-Based Architecture**. This approach allows for breaking down the UI into reusable components. Each component encapsulates its own logic and behavior, making it reusable, testable, and easier to maintain.

### Component-Based Architecture

- **Components**: The app is divided into smaller, reusable components such as cards, headers, and buttons.
- **Screens**: Larger components or pages, which make up the core UI for each section of the app.
- **State Management**: Context API is used for managing the global state, especially for form data across the app.
- **Modularity**: The app is highly modular, with a separation of concerns across `Components`, `Screens`, and `Store`.
  
This architecture ensures:
- High reusability of UI components.
- Clear separation of concerns.
- Ease of maintenance and scalability.

### Explanation of Folders:

1. **Components**:
   - Small, reusable UI components such as cards (`AcademyCard.tsx`), forms (`CreateGoal.tsx`), and other reusable elements that make up the user interface.

2. **Screens**:
   - Entire screens (or pages) that define the main sections of the app, like `Investment.tsx`, `NewGoal.tsx`, and `Portfolio.tsx`. These screens are composed of smaller components.

3. **Store**:
   - State management using **React Context API** for handling the global form state, especially for user-created financial goals.

4. **assets**:
   - Contains static assets like icons and images.

5. **interfaces**:
   - Contains all the TypeScript interfaces for props and global types used across the app, improving type safety.
